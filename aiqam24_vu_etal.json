  "abstract": "This paper explores how to employ ChatGPT to generate university-level question banks. We outline prompt patterns and workflows for multi-type questions (e.g., MCQ, short answer) and build a question bank for a real course. To assess quality and usefulness, we conduct a Blind Test with lecturers and students. Findings indicate strong potential for reducing the time and effort required for assessment design while maintaining quality.",
